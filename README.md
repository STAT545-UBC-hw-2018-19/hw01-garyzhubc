## Who am I?
Hello! This is the repository of Gary Zhu - a Master's student in Statistics. 

## What do I do?
Gary's taking [STAT545 Exploratory Data Analysis](http://stat545.com) - looks like a fun course!
He's also doing research in fishery - ask him about fish if you like to 

* Watch 
  + you can :sailboat: with him 
* Eat 
  + you can dine with him

Tell me what kind of **fish** are they?

- [x] Perch 
- [ ] Halibut
